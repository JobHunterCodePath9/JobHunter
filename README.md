## Overview
### Description
An application where prospective job hunters can quickly swipe on jobs they would be interested in. If they meet the requirements for the job they will be put in a chat with a recruiter. 

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** productivity / career
- **Mobile:** Job Hunter would be mainly accessible through mobile devices but could possibly be launched on computers.
- **Story:** Determines whether user meets job qualifications and puts them in touch with a recruiter. It will allow the user to easily navigate through relevant job listings and their descriptions.
- **Market:** Individuals actively looking or browsing for jobs, who are in or about to enter the job force.
- **Habit:** This app would be used primarily when looking for a job, so it would not be in use often.
- **Scope:** The app would begin as a job search vessel as well as a way to chat with recuiters and then it could evolve into a platform that fuels connections, possibly partnering with LinkedIn or other job sites.
